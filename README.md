# webdanica
System for finding Danish webpages outside the `.dk` domain

The system consists of a ROOT tomcat application (the webapp) running on port 8080, with three embedded workflows
 * a filtering workflow - used to reject undesirable seeds
 * a harvesting workflow, that makes small single seed harvests using a local NetarchiveSuite system.
 * a cacheupdate-workflow, that caches regularly counts for each seeds, criteriaresults, and harvests.

Note that the webapp file `webdanica-webapp-war-$RELEASE.war` on the releases page is the tomcat application file, and the file containing libraries (in WEB-INF/lib) used by the tools and automatic-workflow.

The result of the harvesting workflow is harvestlogs, read by an automatic analysis workflow, that from these harvestlogs 
 * makes parsedText out of the warc.gz files from heritrix3, and then 
 * does criteria-analysis on this text, and finally 
 * ingest the results into the database.

The database backend is HBase (currently 2.0.2) through Apache Phoenix. Building the code has the following requirement in webdanica-core/pom.xml
``` 
<dependency>
      <groupId>org.apache.phoenix</groupId>
      <artifactId>phoenix-core</artifactId>
      <version>5.0.0-HBase-2.0</version>
      <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>
```
Being 'provided' means, that is not downloaded and among the libs included in the produced war-file.
You should locate the phoenix-client-jar used with your cluster, and use this instead of the previously used `phoenix-5.0.0-HBase-2.0-client.jar`.
We are currently used HortonWorks, and their phoenix-client-jar is located here: `/usr/hdp/current/phoenix-client/phoenix-client.jar`

Describing the installation of hbase is considered out of scope for this manual.

Creating the webdanica-tables in hbase are done using the psql.py script and the create-scripts found here: [scripts/hbase-phoenix](scripts/hbase-phoenix).

Please use the scripts from the sourcecode attached to the release on <https://github.com/netarchivesuite/webdanica/releases>, as the scripts on github could be newer.

There are the following create scripts for each of the required hbase tables 
 * `create_blacklists.sql`
 * `create_criteria_results.sql`
 * `create_domains.sql`
 * `create_harvests.sql`
 * `create_ingestlog.sql`
 * `create_seeds.sql`

Sample command to create the blacklists table with connectionstring=`kb-test-hadoop-01.kb.dk:2181:/hbase`
e.g. `psql.py kb-test-hadoop-01.kb.dk:2181:/hbase create_blacklists.sql`

[Building the war-file](warfile_building.md) - The WEB-INF/lib folder in the war-file is used as standard lib folder for the webdanica-tools and the scripts of the automatic and manual workflows.
