When testing the automatic workflow, just add one harvestlog to folder /opt/workflows/harvestlogs-test/
and set the harvestlogdir to this folder in automatic-workflow/conf/webdanica-settings.xml

as in:

<harvestlogDir>/opt/workflows/harvestlogs-test/</harvestlogDir>

Remember to change back the harvestlogDir to /opt/workflows/harvestlogs in automatic-workflow/conf/webdanica-settings.xml
